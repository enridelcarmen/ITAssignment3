            <h3>Aims of  <span class = "text-primary"> Food Helpers</span></h3>
            <p class = "About Food Helpers">  The app is all about being able to help one another.In summary, the app means that in times of crisis or when people are struggling to get by, there is an app that everyone can use to help themselves get grocery items that they may need. People in need can use the app to get free or trade/bartered items and people who are in a position to donate can do so via the app. The app has a delivery component so that people can arrange to have goods delivered to them. </p>

            <p class = "About Food Helpers"> The app can do this by having the user create an account, like facebook. Once an account is created they can search for items, groups and people. They can view items, comments or posts from different sources. The app features payment options but has been created to cater to people in need who want to get hard to find grocery items in times of crisis or obtain free or trade/bartered items. The app could be a good avenue for a charitable organisation to be able to list acquired items that they would like to give to people in need.</p>

            <p class = "About Food Helpers"> From these figures I thought Australia would have been affected in a similar way. I was being cautious in my thinking and as a result, thought that the concept of this app would have a relevant purpose for a much longer time. Coronavirus still exists and there is still no vaccine but rates of infection within Australia have stablised to such a degree that the Australian government is beginning to relax Coronavirus restrictions. So the most important part of the proposed app is to help each other within the community. This concept will always be relevant and with the large amount of job losses in Australia, there are more people in need at this time. With this point in mind, the app will still be able to serve a purpose.</p>

            <p class = "About Food Helpers"> So the goal of the app is still the same and that should always have priority.The app is all about being able to help one another. The app helps one another by having an account based service that users can log into and then search for items that have been posted and have a status of free or to be traded/bartered in exchange for other items.</p>

            <p class = "About Food Helpers"> The app can have a search by so that items can be searched from a user inputted text frame or buttons for certain categories can help the user find items in a more visual manner. This inclusion is necessary as the app is all about searching and finding items that a user will need.</p>


            <h3>Project  <span class = "text-primary"> Outline</span></h3>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Week   <span class = "text-primary"> 1</span></h3>
            <h4>Communication Management Plan</h4>
            <img src="img/capture.png" alt="" class="MatthewPersonlity">
            <h4>Project Scope and Development</h4>
            <p>The name of the app is Food Helpers as the purpose of the app is donate goods that are out of stock through listings and organise delivery of items to designate drop zones. The goals of the app are to assist others who are unable to find certain goods, this would be especially useful in the current situation as there are many people who are unable to obtain food due to several reasons. The app will display listings that can either be text based or include images, a user will need to sign up to require an account. The user can scroll down to find listings which display relevant information such as the owner of the listing, type of food, value of the items and a rating system which displays how trustworthy the user is and a date of the listing. Users can also request listings for specific foods that they may want and can be answered by users that are willing to donate Additionally, users can also organise designated drop-off zones to where it would be convenient to pick up the food. This app can be developed for both computers and mobile devices, however, an app will be developed first as it is the more convenient platform as users can browse through listings for donations and organise drop-offs. The app will be needed as there are many individuals that can benefit from this app, especially due to COVID-19 Pandemic where many people are unable to find food due to people panic buying and there are also people who have an abundance of perishable goods that they may no longer need, which they can now instead to donate it to others in a much more convenient method. This platform will be a safe and trustworthy way for donations, as users will need to pass certain safety requirements for them to be able to donate. With this app we could also save food waste, as instead of being unnecessarily thrown out, it can instead be donated to those who really need it. </p>
            <h4>Risk Management Plan</h4>
            <img src="img/capture2.png" alt="" class="MatthewPersonlity">

            <h3>Week   <span class = "text-primary"> 2</span></h3>
            <h4>Quality Management Plan and Budget</h4>
            <p>For this week of the project we would need to discuss the quality management plan and the budget for the project. The purpose of the quality management plan is to guide the project manager and team members to undertake quality management and quality assurance for the project. This will determine policies and processes that are relevant to the project such as certain standards that each member should follow to complete their tasks at a high standard, appeals to a customer satisfaction criteria that are used to measure if a completed task satisfies the customers and a stakeholder expectations which outlines the criteria of the stakeholders. For example, a review and approval of certain changes to their project. All of these aspects will need to be considered to ensure the project reaches a high standard of quality for the stakeholders and consumers. Additionally we will need to allocate budget for the project to ensure the cost is managed effectively. We will need to keep track of the costs of certain tasks, software, funding and wages. </p>

            <h3>Week   <span class = "text-primary"> 3</span></h3>
            <h4>Task Allocation</h4>
            <p>For this third week we would need to finalise the team members for the project and allocate each member with a task they would need to complete for each week. In order to effectively distribute tasks to members, we will need to identify their strengths and weaknesses with certain roles and skills they possess that will be required for the tasks. Our group consists of five members, Matthew Howaston, Enrique Del Carmen, Russel Lam, Timmy Nguyen and Benjamin Pham. Based on the previous assignments we could allocate each member with tasks they are able to do. Matthew would be assigned as the project manager as he manages the team and has been responsible as the leader of the team since the previous project. Enrique was responsible for the design of the website in the previous assignment, he could be assigned to the tasks involving the design of the UI. As Russel, Timmy and Benjamin were responsible for some of the content in the previous assignment, they could manage programming the aspects of the app. </p>


            <h3>Week   <span class = "text-primary"> 4</span></h3>
            <h4>UI and Technology</h4>
            <p>For the fourth week of the project we would need to define specific UI requirements and some of the technology we will use throughout the project. To design the UI we will need to take into account certain user design features for mobile apps such as limited placement, variable screen widths, and physical environments. Each pixel should be taken into account as we will need to fit only the relevant aspects of the UI due to size of the screens. Additionally, we will also need to consider the variable screen widths of apple and android phones to ensure that all of the UI elements fit properly. Another consideration for the UI is that many users may be using the app while they are out, so they will have a limited attention span due to distraction from environments. For the design of the app we will need to select certain design features such as a  bottom navigation to navigate through the app, pull down action to refresh the listings on the app and on the listings page it could display an image of the listings with relevant information next to it. The design of the app could be done using Balsamiq, which is a user interface designer that can provide us with mockups for the app look. Another requirement of this week is to define specific technology requirements for the app. We will need to select softwares that will be required to create the app such as the programming tools that we will use, any relevant software that will needed when designing the app, software tools testing and any laptop or computers that may be required for the project  and  database management system to manage all the data that is collected on the app. </p>

            <h3>Week   <span class = "text-primary"> 5</span></h3>
            <h4>Functions</h4>
            <p>For the fifth week of the project we would need to roughly define how each feature would work and what would happen if the user selects this option. When the user taps on the icon of the app they will be displayed with the log-in information for the app. If a user does not have an existing information on the app, they will be required to create an account. When the user logs in they are displayed with a navbar which can be used to navigate around the app which displays listings where people put items to donate, requests where people are able to ask for certain items and people can donate to them. When a user goes to the listings they are displayed with some of the images of the food, title of their listing, relevant information such as rating of the donator, type of goods that the listing contains, when the listing was posted, and a request icon which the user will press to request for the listing. If the owner of the listing accepts their request then the owner and the user can negotiate a drop-off zone where the user can pick up the donated goods. For the request feature, a user can request for certain goods. It would function similar to the listings where an icon is displayed next to relevant information such as the goods that they requested, rating of the user, and date of the request. Once the user accepts the request of the donator, they will have to negotiate a designated drop-off zone. The delivery feature of the app will be similar to other listings platforms where the user can request to drop the food off at their house or to another location, there will also be a display of the estimated delivery for the donation items.</p>

            <h3>Week   <span class = "text-primary"> 6</span></h3>
            <h4>High- Fidelity Prototype</h4>
            <p>For the sixth week of the project we would need to prepare a high-fidelity prototype that could be used for our testing in the coming weeks. . In order to do this we would need to adapt our initial mockups from the earlier weeks and combine the functional interactions to develop them to a standard similar to the final release. A high-level prototype will allow testers to get an idea on how the final release of the app will work and receive essential feedback to improve features that are successful and improve upon those that were not successful. Other advantages to a high-level prototype are  that it has a near complete functionality, fully interactive and can be used for a marketing tool. Additionally, the use of the prototype if used as a marking tool can be used to understand the public opinion of the app and possibly secure more funding, as if more people have seen the app, there is a chance they would be interested in using the app.  For the prototype to be made we would need to use a software or website that will allow us to create a high-fidelity prototype that functions similarly to the final version , once this has been completed we would use the mock-up designs to create the prototype interface while improving where we can. Using the interactions from the previous week, it would be included into the prototype for the testers to be able to have a similar idea on how the final product will function. It can also be used for us to have a better understanding on how certain features will function as we're using the app similar to those who will be testing it. This can allow us to implement potential changes that will benefit the users and improve the overall product. </p>

            <h3>Week   <span class = "text-primary"> 7</span></h3>
            <h4>Preparation prior to user testing</h4>
            <p>Before testing of users occurs, there are many things that need to be organised before this happens. User groups need to be identified (this can be determined from the planning phase). Users have to be sourced, either from an existing database of previous users or new tester users can be sourced from online testing websites such as https://www.usertesting.com/. Testing the app needs to have user groups established and users invited to test out the application. Ideally this will be conducted face to face so that people carrying out the testing can observe the people being tested directly. Otherwise, the user testing designed through  https://www.usertesting.com/ will record users while they are carrying out the user tests. Users need to be sent information regarding the proposed app that is going to be tested and the kinds of tasks that will be carried out by the user. The user needs to know if there will be any recording devices recording their actions so that users can sign release and consent forms so that this can take place during the user testing. If testing is to occur face to face, then a location has to be booked or hired and relevant address information and directions must be provided to all users.</p>

            <p>In construction of the actual testing for users, similar competitor apps can be analysed using Neilson’s Heuristics. This will highlight areas of existing apps that work well and areas that don’t work so well. It can determine what aspects of an app need to be tested by users and tasks and scenarios can be developed so that users can be observed or be recorded carrying out the tasks.</p>

            <h3>Week   <span class = "text-primary"> 8</span></h3>
            <h4>Beginning of User Testing</h4>
            <p>User testing for the app can initially be carried out over one day. There is a week allocated to fit in the testing day. One day of testing will be sufficient as there will be a group of 20 users in total that will be tested. There will be enough data gathered from the 20 users to assist in the development of the app. When testing the app, make sure you test on actual devices not in an emulated environment. Make sure that testing is done on multiple devices and on multiple platforms. Test on different screen sizes too. Data derived from the user tests will help inform what areas of the app are working well and used by the test group of users. If there is a need for testing an aspect of the app that either was not tested before or that needs to be re tested, another round of testing can be organised. This can be done outside of the initial 14 week period. For now, it is important to gather data for the first stages of the app development so that the app can continue to be worked on, as it will constantly be evolving. The tests will be carried out individually so that the people running the tests can focus on the user and observe behaviour accurately. Live observations and written down notes will complement any video or sound recordings as certain behaviors or actions recorded may be out of context with what is happening in the environment around each participant. Users will be asked a series of post testing interview questions, asking to give general feedback about how the app worked for them, what were some good features of the app and what were some things that did not work well. Would users recommend this app to their friends? All notes and recordings need to be archived correctly so that data collection can be consistent and quickly gathered. At the completion of each test, each user will be thanked for their time.</p>

            <h3>Week   <span class = "text-primary"> 8</span></h3>
            <h4>Collecting of User Testing results</h4>
            <p>Test Results. Test results firstly need to be gathered from the different sources, so all video and sound recordings will have to be downloaded or stored in a central place. This should have already been done from the previous week, but while collecting all data at this stage, everything can be checked off for each user. All video and sound records will need to be transcribed and saved as text based documents. User testing results can be visualised as graphs and this will help the information to be comprehended and analysed for the further development of the app. All of the data needs to be formatted into a report. The report should contain a Summary of the key findings, the demographics of the users tested, the tasks that were carried out by the users and the results of the tests. What bugs were identified from the user tests, what were the problems users found in the user tests. Any usability problems need to be highlighted along with any other feedback from the users. The user testing reports will help identify what areas of the app are working well and what areas of the app need further developing. These reports will assist in the evaluation stages in the following weeks.</p>

            <h3>Week 10, 11 and    <span class = "text-primary">12</span></h3>
            <h4>Evaluation of the Project</h4>
            <p>Throughout weeks 10 to 12, the project has reached the evaluation stage, as well as the troubleshooting stage afterwards. As you may already know, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many items are being bought out by the community, making it near impossible for many to even find such items on the shelves of supermarkets. Our project consisted of an application/website which would assist in the communities needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, helping those who are unable to access essential items from supermarkets that are being mass purchased by others within the community. The project would allow people to donate and trade items with others during the lockdown, where individuals throughout the community are able to give and exchange essential items for those who are unable to purchase such items. The project also allows for more job opportunity, as we allowed for items to be delivered contact free from possible delivery drivers, in which they would be paid by those wanting their items delivered. During this time, we aimed to obtain an outlined description and overall feedback from our first development, where we can evaluate any problems, issues and flaws that currently run throughout the first system testing. The first stage was to outline and identify any bugs and issues that came with the first set of testing, finding both major and minor problems that need to be addressed before the final prototype. From Week 10, this evaluation stage also included the release of the testing, where we would evaluate other individuals using the system, allowing them to outline any problems and flaws that currently sit within the first prototype. This stage was week 10, which was the application development, allowing both users and the project developers (us) to identify such problems. Week 11 was application testing, where we did most of the testing with a set of individuals, including the test environment setup, test planning and unit testing. The setting up of a testing environment consisted of software and hardware testing units, where we would have to ready both the application and the hardware being used for the project. The test planning would be a testing scope and activities that would be followed and performed by the individual being tested. Lastly, week 11 consisted of unit  testing, where we allowed users to individually test the application, allowing them to perform a set of tasks in order to outline any bugs and problems. Week 12 was the last week of the evaluation and troubleshooting stage, where we had both the User Acceptance Testing and the results reporting of the user testing stage. In this week, the UAT allowed us to identify a specific set of testing that allows the user to see if there are any functional problems and system problems, where they would identify if the application crashes, if all the functions work properly and how well the user can use the software. Finally, the results reporting would be a detailed report of any bugs and problems that were listed and outlined by the individuals testing, allowing the project developers to address such problems. Overall week 10-12 was successful.</p>

            <h3>Week    <span class = "text-primary">13</span></h3>
            <h4>Finalisation of the Project</h4>
            <p>This week, the food helpers’ group are in their final stages and nears the end of the development and release of their application. With the previous weeks results, the application is now satisfactory for the final development of the application. Through this week the group will now need to assign their new role, of project manager. A project manager role must have a strong project management skill as through this is where they are able to coordinate development and delivery processes. This is a vital job to be assigned during this week as the application is now almost in its final phase, the job allows the application to be coordinated through its final stage in an efficient manner by using their management skills directing the production. In addition to the implementation of a new job, the group also aims to develop an end user documentation and an application administration documentation. The aim of these documents is to provide the users of the application an understanding of the app itself. These documents will provide the application with purpose and its functions in which it will describe how the product is used, what services are being offered and how to set up the product. Furthermore, with these documents the application can move on. The step now is to be able to create a disaster recovery plan in which is an area of planning aiming to protect the business from any future negative outcomes. The plan would be made in a comprehensive manner in which it would describe any possible known threats and a plan to combat this in future time. Either through ways such as listing the capabilities of the disaster, what plans need to change like documents, systems, or scheduling. This week is an important week for the food helpers as it is one step closer to the end goal.</p>

            <h3>Week    <span class = "text-primary">14</span></h3>
            <h4>Further finalisation of the Project</h4>
            <p>This week, the food helper has now come to the conclusion of the fourteen-week period, in which now the group needs to finalise their plan for the release of the application. The group now needs to be able to use their end user document and start training. This is where a trainer is allocated from the project team, in which the trainer teaches the other members of the group or staff to better understand the end user, this is important as it allows the team members to understand how the process works and how it could impact the business. In addition to this, the group now needs to create and finalise a plan for a marketing strategy and a plan for the release of the application. The strategy plan would consist where and how the application would be targeted such as how the application would function in the society. The plan would also consist of set clear objectives and tactics that could be used to direct the application to the end users. Similar to this a marketing plan must also be made, this will help the implementation and organisation of marketing tactics. The marketing plan will also provide a plan for sales such as using gathered information to predict and project the plan to reach the application final goal. The marketing strategy and marketing plan is a key step to making the application successful in the society. After the development of a plan and strategy, the group is now close to a state of release , however finalising and overviewing the plans and process would be needed just before release.</p>

            <h3>Time    <span class = "text-primary">Frame</span></h3>
            <img src="img/capture3.png" alt="" class="MatthewPersonlity">
            <p>This can be expanded on and has the flexibility to be extended once the initial 14 week tasks have been assigned.</p>


            <h3>Tools and   <span class = "text-primary">Technologies</span></h3>
            <p>During the creation and development of the project, the only software we require would be the operating systems in which everyone’s devices are using, in this case, windows and macOS, as well as AWS and GitHub for the website development. Other than the operating systems and the website development software, the creation of the application would be any programming software that would allow the developer (us) to code and create such an interface that would allow users to have the functions that we have listed, a coding language that would allow us to complete such tasks would be running java through Eclipse IDE, however, another programming software could be used if preferred. There were no software licenses needed throughout our project. The hardware required for this project was any operating system that would allow individuals to access the web for AWS, Microsoft teams and any programming software. Our preferred operating systems were both Windows and MacOS. Our group members have prior experience with using GitHub and AWS, where the most experienced user of AWS and GitHub, was assigned with overseeing these two parts of the project, where it was most efficient to have the most experienced members. Every group member was also very experienced with their operating systems, as well as with the use of Microsoft teams, in scheduling meetings. Overall, the technologies and tools being used throughout our project was familiar to everyone, making it much easier to work efficiently.</p>

            <h3>Project   <span class = "text-primary">Risks</span></h3>
            <p>Throughout the project, not many major risks could be identified, where the only major risk we had was everybody being unable to attend meetings to report on their progress of the project. However, with such issues, we were able to overcome this problem, with many being flexible to reschedule meetings if one was unable to attend the previous meeting. Other than the rescheduling of meetings, not many major risks were included throughout the project, a couple family issues disallowed one or two members of the project to become unavailable for a short period of time, which was easily worked around. The other only risk of our project was timing, where many of the tasks assigned were not completed until the night before, which wouldn’t be considered a major risk/problem, as the task was completed before the set date. The software we were using was easily understandable for every group member, with GitHub being easily familiarized by other members of the group, as well as the computer systems every individual member was using, was their own personal system, in which they would already be familiar with. Overall, not many risks of the project, other than some rescheduling issues that were easily worked around, and a couple timing issues that were also easily solvable.</p>

            <h3>Group Processes and   <span class = "text-primary">Communication</span></h3>
            <p>Throughout the project, communication was something that our group wasn’t the strongest on, however, we were able to set up meetings and communicate to a level that allowed the project to be completed to a high standard. The only problem we had with communication was setting up an appropriate time in which everyone was able to attend, however, this was easily worked around, as everybody was happy to reschedule if one member was unable to attend a certain time/date. Majority of our communication was done through Microsoft teams; with very few times an email was sent out to remind the whole group of the next meeting time. The communication that was not recorded formally was mainly through the Microsoft teams chat, where we would send a message that would later be replied to by other group members whenever they were available. Another way of informal communication was completed through GitHub, where it allowed us to communicate our html files, where everybody was able to contribute throughout the project weeks. Meetings were taken 2-3 times a week, normally Wednesday or Thursday during the week, and Saturdays on the weekends. This allows for everyone to update their progress on the work, as well as address any problems we have with the assigned work. If a team member did not respond through the communications, emails were sent out to such members, however, the majority of members were active throughout communication. If a member was not available on the day of a meeting, a message would be communicated to us the next day. Overall, communication was good throughout the project, with problems being addressed very easily and rescheduling of meetings was easily done.</p>

            <p>The Food Helpers Team worked well together in Assignment 2. For Assignment 3 we made sure that we divided up the assignment and delegated tasks to each team member so that we could complete all sections of the assignment. We work well together and can work independently on individual tasks, to then combine everything collaboratively.</p>
            <p>We have had some changes within our group where we have had uncertainty with participation from Euan Gibson. Euan had minimal participation in Assignment 2 and has had no participation with Assignment 3. Benjamin Phan participated in Assignment 2 and was initially participating in Assignment 3 but he has not been attending the meetings in the later stage of Assignment 3. As a result, Food Helpers team member tasks have had to be re allocated to accommodate this shift in group member numbers.</p>

            <h3>Skills and  <span class = "text-primary">Jobs</span></h3>
            <p>An application in development has now been funded by a capitalist. With these funds, new jobs and roles are required as now the team can meet the next level of planning and developing. The team consists of six members, in which now all target a different aspect of the development process, jobs such as App developer, Marketing manager, Project manager and Graphics Designer are required in this line of work as the application is based on a app that will help people in this situation of Covid-19 or any in a state of low resources. These positions would require a large degree of skills as each field is different and is important.
