            <h4> Matthew Howaston</h4>
            <p>The scope of Assignment 3 was huge and everyone in Food Helpers did a great job in getting tasks done collaboratively. Initially I found this assignment overwhelming, so I was very grateful to have excellent team mates who were able to help out with pulling the assignment question apart and assisting in the delegation of tasks. Enrique did another amazing job for the website and Russell and Timmy both did a great job in assisting with the information for the assignment. Meetings scheduled were consistently attended by Benjamin, Enrique, Russell and Timmy. Tasks were assigned early on and everyone knew what they were working on. Additionally, everyone was able to work on tasks independently. More recently as Food Helpers were meeting up to finalise the assignment, there were some notable absences. Euan Gibson ended up not contributing towards Assignment 2 and we raised this in one of our meetings with Dr. B where he suggested keeping him in the loop with Assignment 3 - which we did, but unfortunately we did not get any response from him. Benjamin Phan was not present for some of the later meetings and we did follow this up with him. He had some personal reasons for not attending the meetings and was able to let us know. We were able to move some other tasks around to accommodate this.</p>

            <h4> Enrique Del Carmen</h4>
            <p>Assignment 3 was a massive and important assignment for Introduction to IT, however, our group was able to complete it to a high standard by collaborating effectively and splitting the work loads among members. Although we were not able to start the assignment earlier due to other assignments and reasons, we still communicate our ideas and roles that each member would be assigned. Communication between our group was mostly successful, as Matthew, Russel, Timmy and I were able to collaborate to complete our respective tasks. However, Benjamin was not present during the later stages of the assignment and similar to the previous assignment Euan was unable to make contributions. Like our previous assignment, our group was effective at completing the required tasks, as we used Microsoft Teams to collaborate and update each other on what we are doing. However, we also suffered from similar setbacks as Euan was not present throughout the assignment and gave us no reasons for his absence. Unfortunately, Benjamin was not able to make significant contributions to assignment 3 as we had already completed most of the workload. One of the aspects that surprised me was how effective our group was working to complete the assignment in a short span of time, however, this can be attributed to other hard-working members of Food Helpers. </p>

            <h4>Timmy Nguyen</h4>
            <p>Overall the experience with the group was excellent, majority of the group worked well together, as well as doing their best to communicate with each other and joining meetings to stay updated on what work had to be completed towards this assignment. Communication was great throughout the 4 main group members, Matthew, Enrique, Russell and myself. However, Benjamin and Euan weren’t present throughout assignment 3. Things that went well throughout this assignment was the timing of the work, where most of the work was completed 2-3 days prior to the due date, as well as the setting up and designing of the website, which Enrique did a great job on. Communication with Benjamin and Enrique could have been improved; however, emails were sent out as reminders, in which our group leader, Matthew, had not received a reply. One thing that was surprising was most of the group members being happy to reschedule the meetings if one key member was not present throughout, allowing those with assigned tasks to not be left behind. One thing that I have learnt about working with groups is how important communication was, where if one member was not made clear of the assigned tasks, they would be left behind. This also ventures into the communication side, where if we did not communicate with a member at the very beginning, they wouldn’t join meetings to be assigned tasks.</p>

            <h4>Russel Lam</h4>
            <p>This assignment was a challenging assignment in which it was mostly based on researching and understanding. The group did well to tackle this type of assignment by having frequent communications with each other during the weeks before the due date, in which through these communications we were able to separate workload and plan carefully of what each individual is required to do. To add to this the group also succeeded in having all members be able to do what they are confident in which allows everyone to be happy. However, things that could’ve been worked on are that some members were away for meetings in which disable the communication to come through as clearly as it should, in addition another flaw was the time as it took the whole given time to finish this assignment due to the issue of having members not show up. Another flaw was one of the members was absent from the whole process which made the group one man down, in which affected the team management off work. One surprising thing was that with the short-given time everyone was able to finish their work and I also learnt that everyone is capable. The sections I did was Landscape, Week 13-14 and skills and jobs </p>

            <h4> Benjamin Pham </h4>
            <p>I personally think that every member is valuable in their own way, even if there are members that are more important. Timmy is usually the one willing to do any work left that other members can not do and is always an active contributor to any role assigned to him. Russel, as well, is a very friendly team member that is the same as Timmy. He not only tries to be active in discussions and listing out potential issues, he is willing to do things out of his expertise just to help complete work. Matthew and Enrique are the most valuable members as they are usually the ones organising the meeting and doing the heavy lifting. Matthew is a capable and approachable leader who is always on point with his work and does his best to motivate other team members to do the same. He also tries to work out any issues that the team has despite being busy with his own personal work. Enrique is the resident expert as he is responsible for setting up the website through github and allowing the rest of the team to contribute their own work. He’s always available to troubleshoot technical issues and patiently answers any questions the rest of the team may have</p>

            <p>In my opinion, the group is a good team that can get work done efficiently and is friendly enough to not have any issues. Teamwork is one of our strong points and most of the group is generally helpful in any situation so our assignment is done on time with no issues. What could be improved is if the team can be even more active in meetings and setting up regular scheduled check-ups instead of working on everything near the deadline. One thing that was surprising was that we generally improved our workspeed and the quality of our work is of a higher standard than before, though I think it’s because we are used to working together by now. One thing I have learned about groups is that it’s best if morale is high and everyone is friendly with each other so that there would be no miscommunications or errors caused by a lack of contribution or effort by any member</p>
