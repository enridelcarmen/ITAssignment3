            <h3>Enrique <span class = "text-primary">Del Carmen</span></h3>
            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <img class="EnriqueProfilePic" src="img/profilepicture1.jpg" alt="">
            <p class = "Enrique">  My name is Enrique Del Carmen and I am a first-year undergraduate studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I was born and raised in the Philippines and moved to Australia in 2014. For the past five years, I lived in Adelaide, South Australia where I graduated from both primary and high school and live some of the best years of my life. I have had a strong passion for Information Technology since I was a kid which is why I moved to Melbourne to study at RMIT to acquire the best possible education and to expand my horizons in one of the most lively cities in the world. Some of my other hobbies include music, gaming, design and a love of ancient history. </p>
            <p class = "Enrique"> Informtion technology (IT) is a progressive and constantly evolving field, which provides a wide range of opportunities. One of the most interesting aspects of a career in IT is that you are not limited to a few options. There are many job prospects with the right key skills and knowledge including app development, data security, system development, and web design. As the industry continues to evolve alongside technology, there will always be new opportunities for professions involving IT. Furthermore, it is also fascinating to a part of a field that is revolutionising the world. What drew me to information technology as a kid was how fascinating computers are, I wanted to further my understanding about how it worked and what it could achieve, as I increased my knowledge, the more interested I became in IT. This led me to enrol in IT classes in high school where I worked on projects such as app and game development, robotics and web design. Additionally, I enrolled in a Cert III IT course where I learned practical related-work skills, obtained industry-specific knowledge and experience and gained an understanding of IT work environments. </p>
            <h4>Ideal Job</h4>
            <P class="Enrique">The role of a cyber security analyst is to asses, plan and perform security measures to protect the information networks and computer systems of an organisation. This occupation involves simulating attacks to determine possible vulnerabilities, ensure members of the MFB comply to the relevant security protocols and collaborate with a team to secure the IT environment of the company. One of the most appealing aspects of a position of the cyber security is the growth and possibilities, as the world becomes increasingly digitised and reliant on technology, there will be a constant demand for jobs in this industry. Furthermore, in this position, there will be constant work required to protect and improve the security of system, leading to new and engaging challenges.</P>
            <P class="Enrique">From previous experience in high school and a Cert III Vet course for IT, I am building industry-related skills required for my future careers. These include programming languages such as Arduino, C++, C#, Python and Java. I am also able to install and optimise system software, run diagnostic tests, implement system software changes, construct simple relational databases, configure virtual machines and conduct basic system administration. However, I do not have the necessary attributes required for a career in cyber security and instead will use my time in RMIT to build industry-relevant skills for it.</P>
            <h4> Personality Profile </h4>
            <img class="EnriquePersonality" src="img/test1.png" alt="">
            <P class = "Enrique"> The purpose of these tests was to analyse my personality and learning style to determine my key traits and methods of learning. It can be used to further understand myself and possibly improve my approach to studying. The Myers-Briggs test stated that my personality matched certain attributes of the ENFP-Champion, ESFP-Performer and ENTP- Inventor. These personalities include traits such as energetic, passionate, fun-loving and motivated. While these characteristics describe me to a certain extent, I believe that there will never be certain personalities that define me specifically, as I will growing and developing throughout my life. The learning style test determined that my preferred method of learning is auditory. While this my preferred learning style, I can always adapt it to different methods in order to improve how I study. Finally, the big five personality traits test it analysed five key attributes including openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism. Similarly, to the results of the Myers-Briggs test, I believe that traits and personalities will constantly change throughout someone's life due to certain circumstances and events. </P>
            <img class="EnriquePersonality2" src="img/test2.png" alt="">
            <P class="Enrique">The tests indicate that my behaviour would be highly compatible with working in a team. From the results of the Myers-Briggs test the key traits of the personality types I matched state that I will be exceptional at team work as I am energetic, passionate and fun-loving. As an auditory learning, I would be able to listen to other opinions and be open to their ideas. Furthermore, the high agreeability skill indicate that I can cooperate with group members easily. However, prior to these tests, I was already sure that my behaviour was ideal for team work as I have had to collaborate with others countless time and have always been able to work alongside each other to achieve our goals.</P>
            <img class="EnriquePersonality3" src="img/test3.png" alt="">
            <P class="Enrique"> These tests would not greatly affect my decision making when forming teams as I am open to working with anyone. Ideally, I would prefer to work with others who posess similar traits, however, if we can collaborate to achieve our goals it does not matter. Even forming teams with group members with conflicting traits or contrasting methods to approach tasks, I am open to their ideas and would work towards finding common ground with them. Furthermore, if others are facing difficulties with their tasks, I would always try to assist them for us to be able to complete the task in the best standard. </P>

I fundamentally love using computers, testing things out, installing new software and reinstalling operating systems, so I feel I can put this job into "my ideal job" category.

        <img src="img/benpic.jpg" alt="" class="MatthewProfilePic">
        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>I was born in Vietnam and moved to Australia in 2011 in hopes of a better education.</li>
        <li>I've completed the basic education, which means I graduated Year 12, before now studying in RMIT university.</li>
        <li>Aside from the above information, I speak 2 languages somewhat fluently; Vietnamese and English, with the latter being my second language. I also have some education in Japanese but well, let's just say I wasn't exactly top student material.</li>
        <li>My hobbies include playing video games, watching anime and listening to music(mostly Japanese).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Ideal Job</h4>
        <p class="Benjamin"> I've got three companies that are basically my dream job to work for any of them; Blizzard, RiotGames and Valve. Unfortunately, none of the companies has any open positions in Australia but I also don't mind having to move overseas for the work. All of the jobs have some harsh requirements but well, it's a dream job that I have to work towards as my goal so it's expected. I'll talk in detail about Valve since that's my most preferred place to work at.</p>
        <h4>What about this job appeals to you? </h4>
        <p class="Benjamin">Well, it's obviously the fact that the company is at the top of the industry as a well-respected name. Not only do they have the latest software and hardware there, the work that they do are both innovative and industry-changing. Additionally, the workplace according to a lot of former and current employees are very pleasant to work at and has satisfactory work confiditons.</p>
        <p class="Benjamin"> It's listed on the website but I'll summarise it here; Strong grasp of C++, 4+ years of profressional software development experience, strong software engineering skills, good communication and teamwork skills and finally, the ability to finish work independently. </p>
        <h4>What is your plan on getting your job? </h4>
        <p class="Benjamin"> I still haven't graduated university yet so obviously that first... While I still don't have any concrete plans, or any for that matter, the general direction would probably be working for any IT-related company and steadily transition towards the gaming industry while gaining the needed experience and required skills to get the job. That's basically it for now, since I kind of need to learn the basics before thinking any further. </p>
        <h4>Personality Profile</h4>
        <img src="img/bentest.png" alt="" class="MatthewLearner">
        <p class="Benjamin">"INFPs never seem to lose their sense of wonder. One might say they see life through rose-colored glasses. It's as though they live at the edge of a looking-glass world where mundane objects come to life, where flora and fauna take on near-human qualities. INFPs have the ability to see good in almost anyone or anything. Even for the most unlovable the INFP is wont to have pity." </p>
        <p>My traits:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Introvert</li>
        <li>Intuitive</li>
        <li>Feeling</li>

        <p>Key Motivators:</p>

        <li>Listening to and helping others</li>
        <li>Spending time alone to regroup</li>
        <li>Contemplating philosophical or complex challenges</li>

        <p>All ideal jobs are in different fields but all falls under Information Technology with a focus on organizing and manipulating data. These are also common jobs people think of when IT comes up as a topic and all work to satisfy a consumer. They also synergise with each other as IT jobs often collaborate with one another for a project. For example, Benjamin's ideal job as a games programmer might mean that he can work with Russel as a data engineer to work out the plans for a game and look over the coding of each element of said game. Furthermore, Matthew's ideal job can also come in contact daily with Timmy's ideal job as a desktop technician might need the help of an IT support engineer in case of problems. All of these jobs are often found under one company, working together as one big network for a project or product.</p>

        <p>However, all these jobs are also different in that they target different consumers and are often considered to be working in separate industries. Video games would obviously often be Benjamin's only focus but all the others often work in different industries as they have broad enough skills that they can work anywhere IT related. They also might have different permissions to work on minor or major projects as Timmy's job for example, would only require him to work on daily maintenance or work on technical emergencies rather than actively be focusing on an ongoing project. </p>

        <p>In the end, all of the ideal jobs are similar enough, as they all require some mastery over coding, and often work together as one big hivemind to finish or publish a product. Furthermore, they have enough common elements to the point of being able to help each other in case of emergencies or joint projects. However, they are also different in that aside from Benjamin's specific focus, the rest of the groupâ€™s ideal jobs are often placed in different fields of IT and work to target different types of consumers.</p>
