            <h3>What is  <span class = "text-primary"> Food Helpers?</span></h3>
            <p class = "About Food Helpers">  The concept of the app is to either share items - people could have the possibility to donate items, maybe to different categories of people, like elderly people, people with disabilities, people in self isolation, health care workers, other frontline workers and recently unemployed people. </p>


            <h3>What is the state of the art of this  <span class = "text-primary"> new technology?</span></h3>

            <P class="new technology">The app would be using existing technology or ideas that are currently being used in other current apps or websites. Some of the existing technology that would be used in the app is to firstly create an account. Once logged in users could search for items and then this would produce a scrollable list of items, either by text based listings or by image based listings. The individual listing could be selected, either by tapping or clicking to get further details of the item. A similar experience could be likened to “Mu Stuff, Your Stuff” on facebook or an ebay search. The difference with this is that items can be purely donated or traded with other users to get hard to find out of stock grocery items.</P>

            <P class="new technology">Another feature of this app is the ability to organise delivery of items, either to a safe drop zone or outside someone's home. This technology already exists and would be likened to uber eats. The delivery can be viewed live and an estimated time of arrival can be given so the user knows when the delivery has arrived at its destination. To further cut costs down for people who are already struggling, a delivery service could be provided free of charge with the condition that the delivery company has permission to take photos of deliveries to be able to post on their own social media pages for publicity and promotion. The customer would have to agree to this in the terms.</P>


            <h3>What is likely do be done in the  <span class = "text-primary"> near future?</span></h3>
            <P class="future">This is difficult to articulate into words, as I don't have the technical skills to be able to break down the project and give each sub-category an accurate time frame.</P>

            <P class="future">The fundamental idea of the app has to be established and an initial concept has to be developed to get people interested in the proposed app. Once this has been established, then the idea of the app can be showcased to potential investors. Once there is an investor/investors in place, tasks can begin to be broken down and people can be employed to make the app happen. The breakdown of the team will be discussed later.</P>

            <P class="future">Something that needs to be established is getting people to invest or finance the project. This needs to be established so that people can be employed to work on the project.</P>

            <P class="future">The idea of the project can be worked on. The concept of the proposed app can be discussed, pulled apart, and seen if the app is actually relevant to people and financially feasible.</P>

            <h4> User Testing </h4>

            <P class="future">This can be done by implementing the User Centred Design practices where the app can be conceptually tested with users to see how effective the app idea is and if there are any features that the users come across that may improve the app or features that do not work and need to be eliminated. Prototyping the app in paper form or electronically for further testing to users can be carried out after this stage. There are many tasks to complete before the construction phase of a project commences and these will be formulated within the planning stages of the apps and discussed further.</P>

            <h3>What technological or other developments make this  <span class = "text-primary"> possible?</span></h3>
            <P class="developments">As discussed above, there are technologies that currently exist that can be used to create the app. If using the facebook marketplace approach, there is currently the ability to create an account to join the service, which then enables you to communicate with other people, share stories and share photos. Marketplace has the features of payments which is another existing technology. Marketplace enables users to post items for sale. This type of technology can be used to create the food helpers app. Users can search for items, like items, save items for later or purchase items.</P>

            <P class="developments">Other existing technologies which have been discussed above is the delivery driver technology which is used by companies such as uber and menulog. One area of technological advancements that may impact the area of delivery in the future is the idea of self-driving cars and drones eventually replacing delivery drivers. Amazon is testing out drones to carry out deliveries and this service is called Prime Air. This technology has the impact of changing the way items get delivered in the near future and this could change the way the app works with the currently proposed delivery driver system. This is something that may not happen straight away, but if companies are investing and testing the technology, it may not be too far away. The benefits are that there may be reduced costs in delivering items to a customer or user.</P>

            <h3>What is the likely  <span class = "text-primary"> impact?</span></h3>
            <p> The likely impact of the proposed app is that it will make grocery items available for people that are suffering hardship during the Covid-19 pandemic. When the Australian government enforced social distancing measures and encouraged people to stay at home, there were empty shelves in shops and many items became hard to source and/or acquire. The conceptual idea of the app came about from the idea of helping people who were not only struggling, self isolating, older or living with a disability to have access to grocery items that had become hard to find. When this idea or concept was first thought about, the world was in the early stages of the Coronavirus. In Australia, the rates of infection began to rise from mid to late March with a decline in rates of infection mid to late April and with a consistently smaller rate of infection over May.</p>

            <h3>What is likely to change? What is the potential impact of this development? Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
            <p> With consistently low rates of infection there has been a very gradual easing of restrictions. Prior to this, panic buying was starting to ease and grocery items were being replenished in stores and customers were able to acquire hard to get items. In today's Coronavirus climate within Australia, the proposed app idea has lost some of its relevance. With this change, there is still a need to help people who are disadvantaged. People who are older, people living with disabilities, people who have been financially impacted and people who have been on “the front line”. This app has the ability to help people who fall into these categories.</p>


            <h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>
            <p>The app has the ability to help create jobs in the area of delivery driving either through a partnership with an existing company or gaining drivers for the app. If the app was successfully targeting people in need, then there would be a need for delivery drivers to deliver items.</p>

            <h3>How will this affect <span class = "text-primary"> you?</span></h3>
            <p> The proposed app can affect me within different scenarios. If I am someone who needs assistance withHow will this affect  food or general grocery items, I can use the app to see if anyone has donated anything that I need. I can use the app to see if I can trade any items that I feel might have some worth to someone else. Otherwise, if I am someone who is less disadvantaged, I have the opportunity to donate grocery items that I don’t need or barter/trade with other people.</p>

            <h3>In your daily life, how will this affect  <span class = "text-primary"> you?</span></h3>
            <p> In my daily life, having the app will mean that if I need to have grocery items but I cannot afford them, or I cannot physically get to the shops, I can use the app to acquire items and get them delivered to a safe drop off zone near my house or at the front door.</p>

            <h3>What will be different for <span class = "text-primary"> you?</span></h3>
            <p>I can have grocery items that I may not have been able to get or get these items and have them delivered to me.</p>

            <h3>How might this affect members of your <span class = "text-primary"> family or your friends?</span></h3>
            <p>The app can affect family members or friends in that anyone who needs some form of assistance or support during hard times can use the app and source either free items or trade/bartered items or if people are in a position to be able to donate or trade items then they can do so through the app. The app may be able to help your family or friends if you cannot help them directly. If you are someone who is in need and can no longer provide for your family, this app can be another avenue to find some support or assistance in the form of obtaining grocery items. If you have family members or friends who have a disability, this can help people get groceries that are hard to get in times of crisis and get them delivered.</p>
