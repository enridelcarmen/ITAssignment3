            <h3>Idea behind  <span class = "text-primary"> Food Helpers</span></h3>
            <p class = "About Food Helpers">  Our group (Food Helpers) have proposed to create a sharing app for overstocked purchased perishables and out of stock items in supermarket stores, as our project. We chose to venture into such an application, as currently, we are amid the global pandemic known as COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease, where many have expressed on social media about the “out of stock products”. The app mainly aims to achieve a sense of fairness for everybody affected by the out of stock items at supermarkets, in which many individuals have already purchased, ultimately allowing everybody the right to have basic goods and services. The project concept is mainly an area for people to donate items in which many different types of demographics need, mainly, elderly people, people in self isolation, health care works and recently unemployed people. Our project allows individuals to either donate or trade such items with each other, where one individual could have a large amount of one item, such as paper towels, but are in need of soap, thus, allowing a trading system, where it allows them to search for other people that are willing to exchange items. Furthermore, our project mainly focuses on assisting people who cannot go to supermarkets themselves, such as people in self isolation and elderly people, in helping them to have items which would be a necessity for them; soap, toilet paper, food, water, etc. Not only does our project assist those in need of specific “out of stock products”, it also allows for job opportunities for those who are unemployed or are without income from COVID-19, where it would employ such people to offer a safe and contactless service, where they would deliver donated items and traded items from house to house. Overall, our project mains to help those in desperate need throughout this pandemic, with obtaining items and products in which they are unable to purchase. </p>

            <h3>Motivation for <span class = "text-primary"> Food Helpers</span></h3>
            <p class = "About Food Helpers"> FoodHelper’s motivation for our project is simple, it’s to be able to help people. Not only does our app help society during these trying times, it can also help boost the economy by the virtue of being a service app. It’s important to us because not only do all members of FoodHelper want to be able to help in some way, the challenge in somehow making the project a reality is a needed experience for us to learn from any mistakes and get the necessary skills that come from working on our first project.</p>

            <p class = "About Food Helpers"> Our project does not fit in with current IT trends, other than cloud computing just for our database, but we believe it is very topical and relevant in this time. We believe that our future employer would be able to discern our skills from each of the contributions we made towards our project with the results showing our strengths and weaknesses. Not only that it can also tell how well we worked as a team, and how we can work on projects that are relevant to the current trends.</p>

            <h3>How Food Helpers differ from  <span class = "text-primary"> competitors?</span></h3>
            <p class = "About Food Helpers"> This field of this business is growing at times like this because of CoronaVirus, in which there are many similar systems and products available in the marketplace. These products can include UberEats, Menulog, Deliveroo, Woolworths and Coles. These listed products are also considered as competitors as the application we are developing also provides services such as delivery of goods including food. As for example UberEATS provides delivery of food items to the user’s doorstep.</p>

            <p class = "About Food Helpers"> The application we are developing differs from these apps as we allow the user to have a variety of choices such as the ability to donate or exchange goods. As for example if one user discovers they find a good they are no longer using, the user could decide to donate through this app or exchange it for another good which could serve a better purpose for them. However, one similar aspect of our app includes the delivery process of goods as we are using a common way of allocating people to collect and give goods.</p>
